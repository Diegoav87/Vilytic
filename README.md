Vilytic is a web application in where you can search videos that are on youtube to compare their statistics. You can retrieve any video you like by typing keywords and finding it in the search results, or you can search it by video ID.

## Features

## Stack
For this project I used the Django Rest Framework to create the API endpoints, I am using the Youtube API to retrieve all the video data, and for the frontend I am using React JS.
